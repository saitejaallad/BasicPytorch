PyTorch

What is it?
PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Meta (Facebook). It is used for building and training neural networks.
Why is it used?
Highly flexible and dynamic computational graph (useful for research and experimentation).
Optimized for GPUs and TPUs for faster computation.
Popular in academia and research due to its ease of debugging and Pythonic syntax.
Most Important Modules in PyTorch:
torch.nn – Neural network layers and loss functions.
torch.optim – Optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam.
torch.utils.data – Handling datasets and data loaders.
torch.autograd – Automatic differentiation for backpropagation.
torchvision – Pretrained models and image processing utilities.
